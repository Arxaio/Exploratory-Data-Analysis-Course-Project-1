# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Course-Project-1

This is a repository for the Exploratory data analysis Course 1 project. It includes a script called "ExploritoryDataAnalysis.R", which:
* Reads the data "household_power_consumption.txt"
* Converts the rows from character to either numeric, date or time depending on the type of data
* Creates 4 plots as indicated in the assignment instructions and copies plots from screen to a png file

Further, this repository includes the 4 plots which were instructed to be made:
* "Plot1.png"
* "Plot2.png"
* "Plot3.png"
* "Plot4.png"

The 9 Variables from the data are described as follows in the assignment instructions
1.  Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power (in kilowatt)
4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power (in kilowatt)
5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity (in ampere)
7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner.
